    """
    This function needs to be called from within django html templates using:
        {% load render_thumbnail %}

        {% render_thumbnail request url_to_render page_obj as none %}

    It saves a thumbnail/screenshot of the page from within which it is called to page_obj's thumbnail attribute.
    This is accomplished using a selenium browser driver running in a headless configuration.

    Since, when running a local server, this results in the server being pinged twice (once within itself),
    a ConnectionResetError may be output to the console.
    This is safe to ignore (but can't be escaped, with except, for some reason).

    :param request: A Django HttpRequest object, sourced from the page which is calling this function.
        This is needed in order to access additional GET info and to build a full url (including domain).
    :param url_to_render: The relative url of the webpage to render (e.g. '/pages/page_name').
        Accessed within a template using something like:
        {% url 'webpage-view' pagename=webpage.name as url_to_render %}.
        Also needed to build full url.
    :param page_obj: Either a 'Webpage' or 'Template' Django object. Accessed in order to save thumbnail path.
